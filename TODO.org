* Improvements
 - [X] Performance plotting
 - [X] Separate tf interface
 - [ ] Read directly into buckets
 - [X] Buckets to graph function
 - [X] Cost function evaluation
 - [X] Numpy interface
 - [X] Graph to buckets function
 - [ ] Efficient evaluation of einsum (without forming full intermediate)
 - [ ] PEO using memory cost function (same as Chinese article)
 - [ ] Actually delete parallelized variables in slicing
 - [ ] Experiment with different metrics for variable parallelization
 - [ ] Plot predicted time, treewidth, memory vs number of parallelized variables/number of parallel processors
